# TicTacToe
 This is a simple one-file python program that runs with the help of a json file. The game supports both Singleplayer and Multiplayer options and is a windows-console game!

**Singleplayer:**

The game will run in singleplayer mode and the user will play against a bot that learns as it plays. It is like a kid that learns as they play, and the brain's memory of this kid is stored in `predictions.json`. At one point, the bot will become invincible!

**Multiplayer:**

The game will run in multiplayer mode and the user(s) will play against each other.

There are point systems and replays as well!

**Good Luck!**
